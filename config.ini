description="This is a work-in-progress character. They come from a tribe in the desert land and use boxing techniques along with manipulating sand. Their venom is not very potent so they rely on their strength and agility instead, they like to setup traps with quicksand to help them use powerful moves. They are not very comfortable in the air but terrifying opponents when they have a footing in sand."
